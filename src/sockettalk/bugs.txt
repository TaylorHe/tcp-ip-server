KNOWN BUGS:
	1. When resizing, messages disappear if the window height < lines displayed.

	2. Messages disappear when scrolled off the screen. 

	3. Resizing works, but sometimes you have to send a message to fix the screen. 

	4. The cursor always ends at the end of the last printed line from the server. 

	5. Scrolling on the input line. It types fine, and I've tested the actual char* being sent. Right and left arrows still work as intended, you just can't see them.


ATTEMPTED FIXES FOR THESE BUGS:
	1 and 2. I read that disappearing when scrolling and resizing is intentional, as that is how curses handles scrolling. Still, kind of annoying, so...
	I tried created a linked list of all sent messages, and then restoring as many as I can on the screen size so that none are lost. This took many hours, until I realized I failed miserably, and broke everything. 
	git stash is my best friend.

	3. I have tried refreshing the window after resizing but it doesn’t want to work. From my experience, resizing the window right and left work fine, but up and down is strange.

	4. The cursor fixes itself when you start typing again, and puts the cursor back on the input line. I have tried refresh()-ing, wrefresh()-ing after the output but it just doesn’t work for some reason.

	5. I tried fixing this  with the linked list implementation previously mentioned above, but it was getting close to the deadline so I didn't have the time, also due to other finals.
